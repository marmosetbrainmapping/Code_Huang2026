*The cell types and connectivity of primate brains remain unclear. We created a 3-D multimodal atlas of the marmoset brain by combining single-cell spatial transcriptomes, MRI, and retrograde labeling.*
*This multimodal atlas offers new understanding of primate cortical organization and evolution.*

### The process of Stereo-seq analysis of this paper in Stereo_anlysis:

**01.Atlas_plot:** The code that showed the plotting of Stereo-seq cellbin data relates to Figure 1.

**02.Segment2flatmap:** The code used to convert the segment data into segment-flatmap and to combine the cell-type and gene data within the segment-flatmap relates to Figure S1.

**03.Pr-Al_calculation:**  The code that showed the calculation of Pr - Al Index of different data (four species, region - level, segment - level) relates to Figure 2.

**...**

**10.AU_region_gene:**  The code demonstrates the process of showing that the A1 region in humans is more similar to that in marmosets to Figure 7.

**additional.1.MRIflatmaptoshp:**  The code was used to convert the four species MRI gii format (tif format) flatmap into shape file.

**additional.2.MRIflatmapvisual:**  The code that showed how to plot the species shape file of flatmap.
